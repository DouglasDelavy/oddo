One of the biggest challenges when developing a multiplayer game is getting the players to sync up.

When developing spectator mode for a battle royale, I came across the following problem.

Each spectator needs to see all the players in the match on the map. But how would we develop this?

Ok. I agree, there would be a simple solution to make the server send each frame the position of all players for each viewer.
But with 2 or 3 players it would be fine and our problem would be solved, but we needed to scale this to 100 players,
so sending each frame would have probably a big performance problem with our server.

Therefore, the first solution came up, let's add a 3 second interval for each update.

Server-side implementation would be simple, create a loop that every 3 seconds takes the position of all players and sends it to all viewers.

**Server**

```lua
local INTERVAL_BETWEEN_UPDATES_IN_MS = 3 * 1000;

function EmitEventToSpectators(eventName, data)
    TriggerClientEvent(eventName, -1, data)
end

CreateThread(function()
    while true do
        -- Getting all players
        local players = GetPlayers()
        local playersCoords = {}

        -- Iterate in all players to get your position
        for _, serverId in ipairs(players) do
            local playerPed = GetPlayerPed(serverId)

            playersCoords[serverId] = GetEntityCoords(playerPed)
        end

        -- Send to all spectators
        EmitEventToSpectators("royale:client:updatePlayersCoords", playersCoords)

        -- Wait to make all again
        Wait(INTERVAL_BETWEEN_UPDATES_IN_MS)
    end
end)
```

In the client part, the viewer would listen for the update event and create or update the player's marker on the map.

**Client**

```lua
PlayersBlips = {}

local players = {}
local updateEventCookie = nil

local function CreatePlayerBlip(serverId, coords)
    local blip = AddBlipForCoord(coords.x, coords.y, coords.z)

    SetBlipSprite(blip, 1)
    SetBlipAsShortRange(blip, true)

    players[serverId] = { blip = blip }
end

local function UpdatePlayerBlip(serverId, coords)
    local player = players[serverId]

    SetBlipCoords(player.blip, coords.x, coords.y, coords.z)
end

local function UpdatePlayersCoords(playersCoords)
    for serverId, coords in pairs(playersCoords) do
        if players[serverId] then
            UpdatePlayerBlip(serverId, coords)
        else
            CreatePlayerBlip(serverId, coords)
        end
    end
end

-- Called when resource start
function PlayersBlips:start()
    updateEventCookie = RegisterNetEvent("royale:client:updatePlayersCoords", UpdatePlayersCoords)
end

-- Called every frame
function PlayersBlips:tick()
end

-- Called when resource stop
function PlayersBlips:shutdown()
    RemoveEventHandler(updateEventCookie)
end
```

And done, we arrived at a solution, the server will not be overloaded and spectators will see the position of all players on the map.

<div align="center">
  <Image
    alt={"Example 1"}
    src={"/images/syncronize-players-positions/example_start.gif"}
    width={600}
    height={600}
    priority
  />
</div>

However, we have the player markers on the map jumping, which ends up being a problem.

So we move on to a third solution, which would be to use **Interpolation**

### But what is Interpolation ?

Basically interpolation is a technique used to synchronize the position of players in a network. The aim is to avoid latency issues and make the gaming experience smoother.

It works by comparing the player's current position with the past position known by the client. The client then calculates the character's position at a given time in the past using a technique known as linear interpolation.

And that's it, that's exactly what we need.

To begin we need to create the main linear interpolation function which is called **Lerp**

```lua
function Lerp(a, b, t)
    return a + (b - a) * t
end
```

Now we are going to make some modifications in the previous functions to save the time difference with each update received from the server, and modify the way of creating and updating the map marker.

```lua
local lastUpdate = 0
local elapsedTime = 0

local function CreatePlayerBlip(serverId, coords)
    local blip = AddBlipForCoord(coords.x, coords.y, coords.z)

    SetBlipSprite(blip, 1)
    SetBlipAsShortRange(blip, true)

    players[serverId] = { blip = blip, start = coords, current = coords, destination = coords }
end

local function UpdatePlayerBlip(serverId, coords)
    local player = players[serverId]

    player.destination = coords
    player.start = player.current
end

local function UpdatePlayersCoords(playersCoords)
    local gameTimer = GetGameTimer()

    elapsedTime = gameTimer - lastUpdate
    lastUpdate = gameTimer

    for serverId, coords in pairs(playersCoords) do
        if players[serverId] then
            UpdatePlayerBlip(serverId, coords)
        else
            CreatePlayerBlip(serverId, coords)
        end
    end
end
```

Done, just create a function called every frame to make our marker smoother using our interpolation function, **Lerp**.

```lua
function Clamp(x, min, max)
    return math.max(math.min(x, max), min)
end

function PlayersBlips:tick()
    -- get current time
    local gameTimer = GetGameTimer()

    -- some math to substract current tiem to last update dividing by elapsedTime and clamped, to have a bounds
    local timeFactor = Clamp((gameTimer - lastUpdate) / elapsedTime, 0, 1)

    -- Iterate for all players interpolation and setting the current position in map
    for _, player in pairs(players) do
        local x = Lerp(player.start.x, player.destination.x, timeFactor)
        local y = Lerp(player.start.y, player.destination.y, timeFactor)

        player.current = vector3(x, y, player.current.z)

        SetBlipCoords(player.blip, player.current)
    end
end
```

<div align="center">
  <Image
    alt={"Example 2"}
    src={"/images/syncronize-players-positions/example_finished.gif"}
    width={600}
    height={600}
    priority
  />
</div>

Amazing. We were able to solve the problem by having a lightweight server and smooth viewing for our viewers.
